# VoidFall

VoidFall is now maintained as a modular browser game. The current save key and save format remain compatible with the earlier single-file release.

## Project map

- `index.html` contains the accessible page and interface structure.
- `styles/` separates the foundation, HUD, overlays, menus, and campaign presentation.
- `src/core/` owns startup, shared state, input wiring, saves, audio foundations, and the final boot call.
- `src/game/` owns run flow, the campaign finale, Endless Mode, and Guardian modes.
- `src/world/` owns dungeon generation, regional hazards, Resting Flames, and special room encounters.
- `src/render/` owns sprites, environment art, the Ember, and the world interface.
- `src/chapters/`, `src/enemies/`, and `src/bosses/` contain encounter-specific behavior.
- `src/progression/` contains blessings, rarity, forms, and the permanent skill tree.
- `src/story/` contains the hidden Living Archive state, recovered traces, remembered rooms, and all fifty Echo tableaus.
- `src/input/`, `src/combat/`, `src/audio/`, and `src/interface/` contain focused supporting systems.

Scripts are loaded in a deliberate order at the bottom of `index.html`. This first refactor preserves the existing shared runtime so gameplay remains identical. Future changes can replace individual systems with explicit modules without another large extraction.

The Living Archive records behavior rather than presenting an alignment meter. Echo attention, interrupted memories, protected rooms, Resting Flames, and guardian finishes can alter later dialogue, guardian adaptation, environmental details, and the campaign ending. Echo rooms remain enemy-free and let the player move or tap toward the people or evidence inside each restored tableau.

## Running the game

Open `index.html` in a modern browser or serve this directory with any static web server. GitHub Pages can host the directory directly.

## Release direction

Keep editable source in a private repository before commercial release. A later build step can bundle and minify these files for the public web version and package the same build as a desktop application for Steam.
